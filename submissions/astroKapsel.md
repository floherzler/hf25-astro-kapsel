## Project Description
You are observing the earth through time, watching from your capsule in space.
This project puts the astronomical timelines of comets into perspective by summarizing the progress of human civilizations since the last passage.
A countdown until the next passage

## Inspiration behind the Project  
My grandma sent me an article and made me rediscover my fascination for everything space related.
If you think about it, humanity is just on a spinning rock floating through nothing.

## Tech Stack    
I use `Next.js` for a simple web framework and query the [NASA Small Body Database](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/tools/sbdb_query.html) for comets with the user's query.
Comet information and parameters are used to generate and store past and future `flybys`.
These can be used to query the [FAL platform](https://fal.ai) to generate `summaries` of the time period using `google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite`, focusing on human achievements.
FOr these `summaries`, images can be created using `fal-ai/flux/dev` by Blackforest Labs.
