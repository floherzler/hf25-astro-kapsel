## Project Description
*astroKapsel* is an interactive web experience that places the viewer inside a quiet capsule observing Earth from space.  
By tracking the orbits of comets, the project highlights humanity’s history on the timescale of celestial motion — summarizing what we, as a species, have accomplished between comet flybys.

- When a periodic comet returns, we reflect on what has changed since it last passed.
- For long-period or “great” comets, we record *sightings* — singular moments of awe witnessed across cultures.

## Inspiration behind the Project  
My grandma sent me an article and made me rediscover my fascination for everything space related.

If you think about it, we're living on a rock floating through space — and making art, science, language, and memory.
That puts everything in perspective.  

This project tries to capture that feeling.
